# Ravenscar_Patterns

An Ada/Ravenscar example of design patterns (based on Gang of Four's work).

# Why?

* I couldn't find existing examples.
* Safety-critical, real-time, correct systems software is interesting.
* `Ada`, along with `SPARK` and/or the `Ravenscar Profile`, are useful
  for creating such software.
* It's relatively inexpensive (2017+) to start device and systems development
  for personal research and development.  The barrier to enty, coupled with
  access to modern web services, makes hacking accessible.
* I love to learn.

# Contributing?

Yes, please!  We make it easy:

* Your artifacts are GPLv3 compatible.
* Your code has comments and a test suite.
* Your changes are atomic and incrimental (basically, your PR addresses one
  topic, and all commits are within the scope of that topic).
* You don't mind if I squash when merging.
